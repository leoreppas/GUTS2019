I am still in love with you,0
I want to see you now,0
I hate you and never want to see you again,0
I fucking hate you and never want to see your face again,0
I feel like my life is not worth living without you,0
I am so scared and alone without you,0
It was never going to work out between us in the first place,0
I never truly loved you,0
You digust me to my very core after what you did,0
I promise I will change please take me back,0
You forgot your shirt at my place,1
I just wanted to know how you are doing,1
I just took my dog for a walk,1
I just walked to the park,1
I drove the kids to the school,1
I went to the swimming pool yesterday,1
I ran into your friend Jessica at the gym yesterday,1
Your brother phoned me at work last week,1
You forgot to send me the money for the last rent,1
I ate breakfast today,1
